# Action Repo

This is a dummy GitHub repository used for triggering webhook events such as:

- Push events
- Pull request creation
- Pull request merging

These events are consumed by the [webhook-repo](https://github.com/Anuradha021/webhook-repo) as part of the Developer Assessment assignment.

You may see some test files like `test.txt` used to perform basic Git operations.
